# Connecting Pandas and R

Adapting instructions from [here](http://statcompute.wordpress.com/tag/pyper/),
try and connect Pandas and R.

Documentation for `pyper` can be found [here](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v35/c02/paper).

Run the `pandas_pyper.py` to feed a pandas dataframe into R,
perform some calculation on it,
then output the results as a pandas data frame.
